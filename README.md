## Usage

You can use this action after any other action, however I recommend you put it as the last one. Here is an example setup of this action for a pull request:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/test.yml` file in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `test.yml` file.

```yaml
name: Test

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

      - uses: iRoachie/slack-github-actions@v2.3.2
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
        with:
          status: ${{ job.status }}
        if: ${{ always() }}
```

3. Create `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret using [GitHub Action's Secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets). You can [generate a Slack incoming webhook token from here.](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks)

## Advanced Usage

Here's an example with jobs that run in parallel.

It does a few things:

- Lets us know when a status check didn't succeed
- If all jobs were successful, we'll send a message at the end

> Note that the status variable is omitted here.

```yaml
name: Test

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    name: Jest
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn test

  lint:
    name: Eslint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn lint

  notify:
    Name: Slack
    needs: [test, lint] # We only check after the others jobs have run
    if: always() # Always runs even if one of the builds fails
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: iRoachie/slack-github-actions@v2.3.2
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
